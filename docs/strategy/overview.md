# Overview

Basing all my strategy off of State machines for the different creeps and Overlords for the different Tactics and Strategies

Overlords track the overall strategies that the empire is following, things like colonizing a new room, attacking another player.  They are generally used to organize many screeps into a plan and force them to work together.

State Machines drive the strategy of a particular creep.
